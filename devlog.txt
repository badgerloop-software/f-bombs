Currently still just researching about SOC and SOH implementations because I took a break from this project and forgot some stuff.
Thinking of adding candecoder to this repo for now so I can test if the code I make mimics the orion2BMS. 
I don't really know of any other reliable reference for SOC. 
Thinking of just doing the orion2bms as a basic reference and maybe using a kalman filter for a better approximation

research:
- SOC is kinda hard to get but using coulomb counting is good
- succeeds in low noise environments. Which is good for distributed BMS

added Candecoder info: 
- won't be the exact same. 
- stores useful signals in its class private values
added OrionBmsData to Candecoder:
- just a struct of data which has all the data I want for reference

added milliseconds delta_time:
- used to calculate SOC using coulomb counting

bombs constructor:
- sets everything to 0


things to do:
calculate nomial capacity from the voltage using the table that jack sent you
